        "\"Is-a\" Relationship: Inheritance represents an \"is-a\" relationship. For example, a \"Dog\" is a \"Mammal,\" so the Dog class could inherit from the Mammal class.\n",

        "\n",
        "Code Reusability: You don't have to rewrite the same code in multiple classes.\n",

        "Extensibility: You can easily extend the functionality of existing classes by creating new subclasses.\n",

        "\n",
        "  ->Encapsulation in Python is achieved through conventions and name mangling, rather than strict access modifiers like those found in other object-oriented languages (e.g., Java's private, protected).\n",
        "Here's how it's typically implemented:\n",
        "Bundling Data and Methods:\n",
        "Encapsulation begins by defining a class that groups related data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data into a single unit.\n",
        "Access Conventions:\n",
        "Public Members: By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are considered public. They can be accessed directly from outside the class using the dot operator (.).\n",
        "Protected Members (Convention): A single leading underscore (_) before an attribute or method name is a widely accepted convention to indicate that the member is intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses. While still technically accessible from outside, this signals to other developers that direct access is discouraged.\n",
        "Private Members (Name Mangling): A double leading underscore (__) triggers Python's name mangling mechanism. When an attribute or method is prefixed with __, Python internally renames it to _ClassName__memberName (e.g., __salary in a Employee class becomes _Employee__salary). This makes it harder to directly access from outside the class, effectively providing a form of privacy.\n",
        "Getter and Setter Methods:\n",
        "To provide controlled access to \"private\" or \"protected\" attributes, getter methods (to retrieve the value) and setter methods (to modify the value) are often implemented. This allows for validation or other logic to be applied when interacting with the internal state of an object. The @property decorator can be used to create \"properties\" that behave like attributes but internally call getter and setter methods.\n",

        "Code Reusability and Reduced Duplication:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows you to define a common interface or method in a superclass and have its subclasses provide specific implementations. This means you can write generic code that operates on objects of different types through this common interface, eliminating the need to write separate code for each type.\n",
        "Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "It enables the creation of systems that are easily extensible. New subclasses can be added without modifying existing code, as long as they adhere to the common interface. This makes software easier to adapt to changing requirements.\n",
        "Improved Code Organization and Readability:\n",
        "By abstracting away type-specific details behind a common interface, polymorphism simplifies code. Instead of using complex conditional statements to handle different object types, you can rely on the polymorphic behavior, leading to cleaner and more readable code.\n",
        "Dynamic Behavior at Runtime:\n",
        "Polymorphism, particularly through method overriding, allows for dynamic dispatch, where the specific method implementation called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object. This provides powerful flexibility in how objects behave.\n",

        "Here's a breakdown of its significance:\n",
        "Enabling Method Overriding and Extension:\n",
        "super() allows a subclass to override a method inherited from its parent class while still being able to call the parent's version of that method. This enables extending the parent's functionality rather than completely replacing it. For example, a subclass's __init__ method can call super().__init__() to ensure the parent's initialization is performed before adding subclass-specific attributes.\n",
        "Facilitating Code Reusability:\n",
        "By allowing access to parent class methods, super() promotes code reusability. Instead of duplicating code from the parent in the child class, super() can be used to invoke the existing implementation, leading to more concise and maintainable code.\n",

        "Unlike regular methods, __del__ is not called directly by the programmer. Instead, it is automatically invoked by the Python interpreter when an object's reference count drops to zero and the object is eligible for garbage collection.\n",
        "Considerations and Limitations:\n",
        "Uncertain Timing:\n",
        "The exact timing of __del__ invocation is not guaranteed, as it depends on the garbage collector's schedule. This can be problematic for critical resource release, where immediate cleanup is required.\n",
        "Circular References:\n",

        "For predictable and reliable resource management, especially for resources that need to be explicitly opened and closed, context managers (using with statements and __enter__/__exit__ methods) are generally preferred over __del__. They ensure resources are released even if errors occur during execution."
