        "Code Reusability: You don't have to rewrite the same code in multiple classes.\n",

        "Extensibility: You can easily extend the functionality of existing classes by creating new subclasses.\n",

        "\n",
        "  ->Encapsulation in Python is achieved through conventions and name mangling, rather than strict access modifiers like those found in other object-oriented languages (e.g., Java's private, protected).\n",
        "Here's how it's typically implemented:\n",
        "Bundling Data and Methods:\n",
        "Encapsulation begins by defining a class that groups related data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data into a single unit.\n",
        "Access Conventions:\n",
        "Public Members: By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are considered public. They can be accessed directly from outside the class using the dot operator (.).\n",
        "Protected Members (Convention): A single leading underscore (_) before an attribute or method name is a widely accepted convention to indicate that the member is intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses. While still technically accessible from outside, this signals to other developers that direct access is discouraged.\n",
        "Private Members (Name Mangling): A double leading underscore (__) triggers Python's name mangling mechanism. When an attribute or method is prefixed with __, Python internally renames it to _ClassName__memberName (e.g., __salary in a Employee class becomes _Employee__salary). This makes it harder to directly access from outside the class, effectively providing a form of privacy.\n",
        "Getter and Setter Methods:\n",
        "To provide controlled access to \"private\" or \"protected\" attributes, getter methods (to retrieve the value) and setter methods (to modify the value) are often implemented. This allows for validation or other logic to be applied when interacting with the internal state of an object. The @property decorator can be used to create \"properties\" that behave like attributes but internally call getter and setter methods.\n",

        "Polymorphism allows you to define a common interface or method in a superclass and have its subclasses provide specific implementations. This means you can write generic code that operates on objects of different types through this common interface, eliminating the need to write separate code for each type.\n",

        "Improved Code Organization and Readability:\n",

        "Dynamic Behavior at Runtime:\n",

        "Purpose: To provide an \"informal\" or \"user-friendly\" string representation of an object.\n",

        "Here's a breakdown of its significance:\n",
        "Enabling Method Overriding and Extension:\n",
        "super() allows a subclass to override a method inherited from its parent class while still being able to call the parent's version of that method. This enables extending the parent's functionality rather than completely replacing it. For example, a subclass's __init__ method can call super().__init__() to ensure the parent's initialization is performed before adding subclass-specific attributes.\n",
        "Facilitating Code Reusability:\n",
        "By allowing access to parent class methods, super() promotes code reusability. Instead of duplicating code from the parent in the child class, super() can be used to invoke the existing implementation, leading to more concise and maintainable code.\n",
        "Managing Complex Inheritance Hierarchies (especially Multiple Inheritance):\n",
        "In scenarios involving multiple inheritance, super() becomes crucial for correctly navigating the Method Resolution Order (MRO).

        "Promoting Flexibility and Maintainability:\n",

        "Resource Management:\n",
        "The primary purpose of __del__ is to provide a hook for performing cleanup actions when an object is about to be destroyed. This is crucial for releasing external resources held by the object, such as:\n",
        "Closing open file handles.\n",

        "Unlike regular methods, __del__ is not called directly by the programmer. Instead, it is automatically invoked by the Python interpreter when an object's reference count drops to zero and the object is eligible for garbage collection.\n",
        "Considerations and Limitations:\n",
        "Uncertain Timing:\n",
        "The exact timing of __del__ invocation is not guaranteed, as it depends on the garbage collector's schedule. This can be problematic for critical resource release, where immediate cleanup is required.\n",
        "Circular References:\n",
        "In cases of circular references, where objects refer to each other in a loop, the garbage collector might not immediately detect that the objects are no longer reachable, potentially delaying or preventing __del__ invocation.\n",

        "For predictable and reliable resource management, especially for resources that need to be explicitly opened and closed, context managers (using with statements and __enter__/__exit__ methods) are generally preferred over __del__. They ensure resources are released even if errors occur during execution."
